<h3 style="text-align: center;">DREAMS</h3>
<li style="text-align:center">Many people have their own dream and also me. I also have my own dream which is i want to attend all of the concert by my favourite artist such as Dream Perfect Regime (DPR), Mew Suppasit, Gulf Kanawut and also Jeff Satur. Since 2020, i already watched more than 3 concerts and im enjoying myself during the concert singing alone with my favourite artist and the crowd because sometimes all of the people also need to escape from their daily life reality which are works and study.</li>
